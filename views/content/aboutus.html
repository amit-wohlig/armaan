                        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                        <p>The journey of Armaan began in 2008, after 15 years of experience in distributing frozen foods, across the UK. The founder, Mr Mudassir Yakub, introduced his own home brand under the name of <a href="#" class="armaan_link">Armaan</a>. He had the desire and need to provide good quality frozen foods at affordable prices. Since then Armaan has been increasing in variety and choice to the consumers, constantly innovating new and fascinating frozen food product lines. At Armaan Frozen Foods we understand what good quality and a great price means. Using only the very finest ingredients, Armaan Foods produces a vast range of ethnic frozen foods. We believe that convenience does not need to come at a steep price. Each product is carefully sourced and packaged, then stored in custom built cold rooms to retain their freshness. Here at Armaan we enjoy mixing contemporary flavours and ingredients to classic, traditional Indian favourites. We value that authenticity is key to any Indian dish, but without the hassle and time consuming preparation that goes along with modern day life. We manufacture a vast range of ethnic foods sourced from all over the world; this includes vegetarian, non-vegetarian and fish products. Our entire meat is all 100% HMC Certified. At Armaan Frozen Foods we trust you will find exactly what youâ€™re looking for. We distribute all over the UK all year round, with a service that is prompt and reliable, ensuring our customers receive a first class service. Our brand is built on service and confidence therefore should any of our products not satisfy your requirements; we shall gladly refund or exchange your purchase. We ensure that there is no delay in delivering goods to you, and we make certain that all our goods are delivered as per our pre-arranged agreed delivery schedule.</p>
